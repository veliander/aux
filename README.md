Nothing of interest here, I'm just using GitHub as a free web hosting solution.

This repo contains a redirector to a web application I wrote to prove the concept of replacing numeric conference IDs with sequences of words, allowing callers to use voice input instead of DTMF. To experience the app, make sure you're using a desktop version of Google Chrome and head to https://demo.hexia.org.
